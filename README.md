# Tachikoma Proompt Cookbooks 🕷️

**Agent coordination system for AI-assisted development.**

A modular framework that helps AI agents understand your project structure, follow your conventions, and route tasks to appropriate specialists.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Orchestrator Pattern**: Primary agent (Tachikoma) coordinates all activity
2.  **Intent-Based Routing**: Classifies requests and routes to appropriate skills/subagents  
3.  **Context Modules**: Project-specific rules that load based on task type
4.  **Self-Learning**: Tracks patterns and suggests improvements

Named after the adaptive AI tanks from *Ghost in the Shell* — always learning, always asking questions.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

This system uses a **primary orchestrator** pattern where Tachikoma (the primary agent) handles all incoming requests, classifies them, and routes to the appropriate specialist.

### Architecture Overview

```
User Request
    ↓
Tachikoma (Primary Agent)
    ↓
Intent Classification (skill)
    ↓
Route Decision (config-driven)
    ↓
    ├── Simple Task → Skill (e.g., code-agent)
    ├── Complex Task → Subagent (e.g., rlm-subcall)
    └── Ambiguous → Ask user for clarification
```

### Request Processing Flow

1.  **Receive**: Tachikoma receives the user request
2.  **Classify**: Loads `intent-classifier` skill to determine intent and confidence
3.  **Load Context**: Reads relevant context modules from `.opencode/context/`
4.  **Route**: Checks `.opencode/config/intent-routes.yaml` for routing rules
5.  **Execute**: Either handles directly (skills) or delegates (subagents)
6.  **Report**: Returns results with routing details and confidence levels

### Intent Routing Table

| Intent | Context Modules Loaded | Execution Target | Use Case |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|----------|
| **debug** | core-contract, coding-standards | code-agent skill | Fixing bugs and errors |
| **implement** | core-contract, coding-standards, commenting-rules | code-agent skill | Writing new code |
| **research** | core-contract, research-methods | research-agent skill | Finding information |
| **review** | core-contract, coding-standards | analysis-agent skill | Code analysis |
| **git** | core-contract, git-workflow | git-commit / pr skills | Version control |
| **complex** | core-contract | rlm-subcall subagent | Large context processing |

**Note:** The orchestrator loads context modules in priority order (lower numbers first) before executing any task.

---

## 📝 Planning vs Implementation

Tachikoma has full tool access (read, write, edit, bash). Depending on your workflow preference:

### Option A: Plan First (Recommended for complex work)

**When to use:** Large features, refactoring, or when you want to review before executing

1. **Start with OpenCode's built-in Plan agent** (or your IDE's planning mode)
   - Read-only analysis
   - Explore the codebase
   - Create implementation plan
   - No risk of accidental changes

2. **When ready to implement, press Tab and switch to Tachikoma**
   - Tachikoma receives the plan
   - Executes with context modules loaded
   - Can make changes, run commands, delegate to subagents

**Benefits:** 
- Peace of mind during exploration
- Review plan before committing to changes
- Clear separation between analysis and implementation

### Option B: Let Tachikoma Handle Everything

**When to use:** Simple tasks, quick fixes, or when you're confident in the approach

1. **Stay on Tachikoma from the start**
   - Tachikoma classifies your request
   - Loads appropriate context
   - Routes to skills or subagents automatically
   - Executes immediately

**Benefits:**
- Faster for straightforward tasks
- No context switching
- Full automation

## 🚀 Installation (Drop-in Framework)

### Quick Setup

1.  **Copy to your repo:**

    ```
    cp -r .opencode AGENTS.md /path/to/your/project/
    ```

2.  **Don't ignore these these files:**
    - `AGENTS.md` or `.opencode/`
    - The agent needs them at repo root to pick them up.
    - Up to you if you want to commit them to your repo.

3.  **That's it.** The system wakes up and starts learning immediately.

See the [full framework structure](#-framework-structure) below for details.

### Customizing for Your Project

**Adding Project-Specific Rules:**

Create a new context module in `.opencode/context/`:

```bash
# Create context module with appropriate priority (40-60 range)
cat > .opencode/context/40-my-project.md << 'EOF'
---
module_id: my-project-rules
name: My Project Patterns
priority: 40
depends_on:
  - core-contract
  - coding-standards
---

# My Project Specific Rules

## Testing Requirements
Always run `npm test` before committing.

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase
- Utilities: camelCase  
- Constants: UPPER_CASE

## Project Structure
src/
  components/    # React components
  utils/         # Helper functions
  types/         # TypeScript definitions
EOF
```

**Adding Custom Intents:**

Edit `.opencode/config/intent-routes.yaml`:

```yaml
routes:
  my-custom-intent:
    description: Description of what this intent means
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    context_modules:
      - 00-core-contract
      - 40-my-project
    skill: code-agent
    tools:
      - Read
      - Write
      - Bash
```

**Providing Feedback:**

The system monitors interactions for learning opportunities:

```
User: "Learn this: Always run lint before committing"
System: Detects pattern → Proposes adding to git-workflow context
User: Approves → Updates git-workflow.md
```

**Confidence Thresholds:**

Adjust routing sensitivity in `intent-routes.yaml`:
- High threshold (>0.8): Strict routing, more user clarification
- Low threshold (<0.5): Permissive routing, may misroute

## 🎯 System Components

### Primary Agent (Tachikoma)

Located at `.opencode/agents/tachikoma.md`, this is the main entry point that coordinates all activity:

**Responsibilities:**
- Intent classification via `intent-classifier` skill
- Context module loading based on classified intent
- Route determination via `intent-routes.yaml` config
- Skill/subagent invocation
- Result synthesis and reporting

**Configuration:**
- Mode: `primary` (TAB-switchable agent)
- Temperature: `0` (deterministic)
- Full tool access with task invocation permissions

### Context Modules

Reference documentation in `.opencode/context/` that defines project standards:

| Module | File | Purpose | Load Priority |
|--------|------|---------|---------------|
| Core Contract | `00-core-contract.md` | Foundational rules, precedence, minimal change | 0 (always first) |
| Coding Standards | `10-coding-standards.md` | Design patterns, style guidelines | 10 |
| Commenting Rules | `15-commenting-rules.md` | Comment philosophy and requirements | 15 |
| Git Workflow | `20-git-workflow.md` | Commit conventions, validation commands | 20 |
| Research Methods | `30-research-methods.md` | Investigation methodology | 30 |
| Prompt Safety | `50-prompt-safety.md` | Safety frameworks and compliance | 50 |

**Usage:** Tachikoma loads these in priority order before executing any task. Lower priority numbers load first.

### Skills

Executable capabilities in `.opencode/skills/` that perform specific tasks:

| Skill | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Intent Classifier | `intent-classifier/SKILL.md` | Classify user queries into intents |
| Code Agent | `code-agent/SKILL.md` | Implementation and debugging |
| Analysis Agent | `analysis-agent/SKILL.md` | Code review and evaluation |
| Research Agent | `research-agent/SKILL.md` | Investigation and fact-finding |
| Git Commit | `git-commit/SKILL.md` | Git operations |
| PR | `pr/SKILL.md` | Pull request creation |
| Workflow Management | `workflow-management/SKILL.md` | 6-phase development workflow |
| Task Tracking | `task-tracking/SKILL.md` | Task management system |

**Invocation:** Tachikoma reads the SKILL.md file and applies its patterns to the current task.

### Subagents

Specialized agents in `.opencode/agents/subagents/` for isolated or complex work:

| Subagent | Location | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| RLM Subcall | `core/rlm-subcall.md` | Large context processing (>2000 tokens) |

**Invocation:** Via `task(subagent_type="rlm-subcall", ...)` from Tachikoma.

### Configuration

**`.opencode/config/intent-routes.yaml`** - Defines routing logic:

```yaml
routes:
  debug:
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    context_modules:
      - 00-core-contract
      - 10-coding-standards
    skill: code-agent
    
  implement:
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    context_modules:
      - 00-core-contract
      - 10-coding-standards
      - 15-commenting-rules
    skill: code-agent
```

### Self-Learning Mechanisms

The system includes feedback loops for improvement:

1. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies repeated user corrections
2. **Confidence Tracking**: Monitors classification accuracy
3. **Tool Discovery**: Auto-detects project validation commands
4. **Proposal Generation**: Suggests context module updates

**Note:** All learning proposals require user approval before implementation.

### Pre-Built Workflows

Additional specialized skills included:

- **Code Review**: Priority-based review classification
- **Prompt Engineer**: Safety and bias mitigation patterns
- **Security Audit**: OWASP-based vulnerability scanning

## 🛠️ Compatibility

This framework is designed to play nice with OpenCode and the [SKILLs](https://agentskills.io/specification) format.

**Should work with:**

- Any AI agent that can read files from your repo
- Local models via Ollama, LM Studio, etc.
- Custom agent integrations

### Notes

Copilot is doing a lot of the heavy lifting here —
work pays for it, so I'm turning the knobs and trying **every model it'll let me** 😄

---

### Disclaimer

AI agents vary wildly by model, tool, and prompt plumbing.
**Your mileage may vary.**
Experiment and trust local results over lists like this.
