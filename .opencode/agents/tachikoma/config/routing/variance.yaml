# Strategic Variance Configuration
# Introduces controlled randomness for more interesting/creative outputs
#
# Variance Levels:
#   - low: Standard deterministic behavior (default)
#   - medium: 20% chance of creative deviation
#   - high: 40% chance of creative deviation, higher temperature
#
# Use Cases:
#   - Brainstorming sessions
#   - Exploratory coding
#   - "Surprise me" requests
#   - Learning/demonstration scenarios
#
# IMPORTANT: Strategic variance should NOT be used for:
#   - Security-critical code
#   - Production deployments
#   - Data migrations
#   - Any task requiring deterministic output
